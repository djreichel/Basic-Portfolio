            <p><b><i>(Since sometime in the mid 1980s)</i></b> I've been an art director/graphic designer working on mostly printed projects for 30+ years. When I first started in this line of work I sat at a drawing board. A few of the tools I used regularly were a t-square, exacto knife, rubber cement, markers, layout paper, stat camera and presstype.</p> 
            <p>I bought my first computer in 1992. It was a MAC IIci with 8 MB RAM and 80 MB storage. I remember it would take several minutes to open a fairly small Photoshop file. That's usually when I went to get a fresh cup of coffee. And then it would take several minutes to save the same file. Nobody was ever in a hurry back then.</p> 
            <p><b><i>(January 2019)</i></b> I've become a new student in the CWRU Coding Bootcamp focused on MERN stack web development. Our first order of business is learning front-end programming with HTML, CSS and Javascript. More to come as this endeavor unfolds.</p>
